      - inline script: you can directly add the script in the same file
                        `<script> console.log("Hello world!"); </script>`
      - external script: we can also create the javascript file externally
                          `console.log('Hello World!);`  
                         and add them to the html file using script
                          `<script src="script.js"></script>`
